## Dataset Features Overview

This dataset includes various environmental and meteorological factors influencing solar power generation. Here’s an explanation of each feature:

1. **temperature_2_m_above_gnd**: Temperature at 2 meters above ground level, measured in degrees Celsius. Higher temperatures can impact solar panel efficiency.

2. **relative_humidity_2_m_above_gnd**: Relative humidity at 2 meters above ground, represented as a percentage. High humidity might reduce solar power generation due to cloud formation or atmospheric moisture.

3. **mean_sea_level_pressure_MSL**: Atmospheric pressure at mean sea level, measured in hectopascals (hPa). Shifts in pressure often indicate changing weather patterns, affecting solar output.

4. **total_precipitation_sfc**: Total precipitation at surface level, measured in millimeters. Rainfall reduces solar energy generation by increasing cloud cover or obstructing sunlight on panels.

5. **snowfall_amount_sfc**: Total snowfall at surface level, measured in millimeters. Snow can obstruct sunlight, leading to decreased power generation.

6. **total_cloud_cover_sfc**: Percentage of cloud cover at surface level. More cloud cover typically reduces sunlight reaching the panels, lowering power output.

7. **high_cloud_cover_high_cld_lay**: Percentage of high-altitude cloud cover. High clouds can impact solar radiation, but typically less than low clouds.

8. **medium_cloud_cover_mid_cld_lay**: Percentage of medium-altitude cloud cover. These clouds have a direct impact on reducing solar radiation.

9. **low_cloud_cover_low_cld_lay**: Percentage of low-altitude cloud cover. Low clouds can significantly reduce solar energy by blocking direct sunlight.

10. **shortwave_radiation_backwards_sfc**: Shortwave radiation reflected from the surface, measured in watts per square meter (W/m²). This indicates how much light is reflected rather than absorbed by the surface.

11. **wind_speed_10_m_above_gnd**: Wind speed at 10 meters above ground, measured in meters per second (m/s). Wind can cool down solar panels, which may help maintain efficiency on hot days.

12. **wind_direction_10_m_above_gnd**: Wind direction measured at 10 meters above ground, in degrees. Understanding wind direction can provide context on weather patterns.

13. **wind_speed_80_m_above_gnd**: Wind speed at 80 meters above ground, in m/s. Higher-altitude wind speeds may indicate broader weather changes, which can affect cloud cover and temperature.

14. **wind_direction_80_m_above_gnd**: Wind direction at 80 meters above ground, in degrees. Knowing wind direction at this height can help forecast large-scale weather changes.

15. **wind_speed_900_mb**: Wind speed measured at the 900 millibar pressure level, in m/s. Wind speed at this atmospheric pressure level is relevant for forecasting broader weather conditions.

16. **wind_direction_900_mb**: Wind direction at the 900 mb pressure level, in degrees. This provides additional context for understanding weather systems that may impact solar generation.

17. **wind_gust_10_m_above_gnd**: Maximum instantaneous wind speed (gusts) at 10 meters above ground, in m/s. Strong gusts can impact equipment stability and may have minor cooling effects on panels.

18. **angle_of_incidence**: The angle at which sunlight strikes the solar panels, in degrees. Lower angles mean more direct sunlight, which enhances energy generation efficiency.

19. **zenith**: Solar zenith angle, which is the angle between the sun’s rays and the vertical. Lower zenith angles indicate the sun is directly overhead, leading to higher solar energy potential.

20. **azimuth**: Solar azimuth angle, representing the compass direction of sunlight. This angle helps optimize solar panel positioning.

21. **generated_power_kw**: The amount of power generated by the solar panel, measured in kilowatts (kW). This is the target variable for predictive modeling or analysis.
